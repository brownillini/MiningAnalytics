Below the Mix hopper was empty, ran up to the Sand and Pebble hopper and it had at least 3 batches in it, had to open doors manually to get it to drop out.  After that the doors would not communicate, the limit switches were not working properly.  A flush was already sent to U/G so we had to drop material to the floor.  When the batches dropped it shot out the sample doors.  Large messes on bottom two levels.  The cement chute also plugged off from the bottom shroud up to the rubber sleeve.  It was very hard towards the bottom, may have been plugging off over time and contributed to the issue.","Michael Little","","Craig Shiner","Silas Walls  (015163)","Closed","","4/14/2021","","en"

This resulted in multiple problems. First, BC-44 clogged. Aaron cleared the chute but did not notice the ice. Next, when the mixer doors opened the load failed to drop out. As this has been part of an ongoing problem, Aaron let the system cycle thinking it would drop out next batch. It did not so he went into manual and opened the mixer doors. The Mercedes valve immediately plugged. Aaron opened the dump valve, inspected it and noticed the ice. He contacted Mat and let him know about the problem - Josh came to assist and Mat drove to the head frame in case we needed to flush from there. As there was too much ice to get out by hand, Aaron opened the fresh water flush line with the dump valve open to try and push it out. He then put the Mercedes back together and attempted to continue the pour. The Mercedes immediately plugged again. At this point approximately 10 minutes had passed so Aaron attempted to send a flush. Josh opened the Mercedes dump valve and Aaron opened the mixer doors and the Schwing pump dump valve. They both had more frozen chunks of sand and the Schwing pump would not drain. Aaron cleared the plug with a sledge and by hand and then turned on the mix water to push any remaining ice out. They closed both valves and attempted to send a flush. The Schwing pump started and the water turned on but they noticed the discharge pressure was 1-5, too low to be sending water. Aaron went to the second deck, opened the hatch to view the charge hopper and saw that it was filling up and soon started to spill over. More ice must have been plugging the charge hopper just above the Schwing pump discharge. Aaron contacted Mat and informed him he would need to send a flush from the head frame. Shortly after the ice must have dropped out as the charge hopper level started to come down. The discharge pressure went to 20 and the 5900 level pressure started to rise so they assumed they were successfully sending a flush. They informed Mat he would not need to flush from up top. Around 22 minutes passed between the initial clog and the successful flush. As the pour was nearly complete, 1/2 feet from the top of the wall, underground decided to call the pour there and they shut down.","","","Craig Shiner","","Draft","2/26/2021","","Aaron Achord (015391)","en"

It looks like the flow thru that pipe was then back draining to the spare filter and draining out the filter drain to the floor and eventually to the sump that alarmed the high level.

We were able to get the primary pump running again and were showing flow to the 003 surge.

Hawk Inlet generation switched on auto with no issues.  Rick Freed was at the 920 and brought the lights back on, All power was restored at the 920 and stable around 3:00 am.  The only issue was the sag motor had a fault with the RTD electricians worked with the electricians on channel 1 to resolve the fault.  Jeff Swanson, Chet Creamer and Jody Squires went up to check the road at 4:00 am and pulled into  4.7 to talk to Mike Stocks and Jesse Boudreau.  After talking to Mike Stocks we sat at 4.7 to observe the trees crashing and talking.  The decision was made to leave 4.7 and go back to camp to inform the Green Creek team the road was closed until daylight so we could access the damage.  At this point we informed the electricians there may be power lines down and would need their help.  Went back up to 4.7 with the three electricians and pulled off.  We had Brian Tatlow and Mike Flansas head down the hill at 8:00 am so we could have the daylight to access the road.  The road was cleared to 4.7 around 8:10.  Everyone was told to re-group at 4.7 to discuss the road conditions with Brian Tatlow who had just cleared the road.  The report was the road was accessible to go to go to the 920 to get the high voltage gear to deal with any highline issues.  The loader and three pickups proceeded up to the 920, right at 4.8 there was a micro burst and we tried to go back to the 4.7, the trees blew down on the trucks, powerline and road.  This snapped power poles and powerlines for at least or close to a mile.  The rear pickup was able to clear themselves after a tree had damaged the bed.  The loader and the two trucks were able to work there way to the 4.9 turn out.  The situation was re-assessed, everyone was safe and okay.  It was then re-assessed that we had to cut our way back out to the 4.7.

After continuing to work for a while later, Francis stated that he wasn't feeling good and needed to take a break which he did.  Darren continued working until he came to an area where he needed help.  Francis helped him finish and then both returned to the surface.  Francis then told Darren that he wasn't feeling well and went home early.  According to Darren, who is an experienced underground worker, it was not overly hot in the ramp and there were no other equipment working in the area.  Darren stated there were some contributing factors to this incident.  Francis was off for a week, worked one day dayshift and then switched to nightshift the next day.  He was unable to get to sleep the day before and told Darren he had worked on his new house during the day.  Francis also told Darren before they started to work that he didn't feel real good and had a headache but was well enough to work.","","","Scott Hogamier","Lance Boylan (009491)","Assign for Investigation","10/30/2020","","Health & Safety Coordinator","en"

This in turn corrupted our flotation by greatly altering the pH. This pH swing was made its way through flotation and eventually through to the water treatment plants.  As the pH at WTP-002 increased into 9.0 range we decided to stop discharging our effluent and instead would recycle to ensure we did not exceed the daily maximum pH range.  As this was going on more slurry was accumulating in the flotation basement which would eventually make it's way to tails and ultimately through water.  We attempted to send most of this material through the Geho lines to Pond 4 but some would ultimately overflow the thickener and head towards treatment.  By the time we were able to startup WTP-002, which was about 36 hours later, we knew we would have more solids so we increased PTB-50, the flocculant and the coagulant in the system.  We took our compliance sample on Thursday and ultimately failed compliance due to having both high dissolved lead and high particulate lead in our sample.  This continued to be a problem through the weekend even with water balance changes that were made and ultimately the plant was shut down until we can assure we are treating the water appropriately.  This resulted in a maximum daily limit exceedance for Outfall 002 on the 9/25/2020 compliance sample.  The investigation is ongoing.","","","Lance Boylan","Environmental Coordinator","Investigate","10/9/2020","","Lance Boylan (009491)","en"

At first we didn't know what was causing these problems and we tried to remedy by adjusting reagents.  Later in the shift our crusher operator began finding chunks of shotcrete on the feed belt.  Once he let us know what he was seeing we had him begin collecting all the shotcrete off the belt and saving it for inspection.  Once we determined there was a significant amount of shotcrete in the feed we were determined that this was the root cause of our problems with pH in the flotation circuit and water.

The purpose of the inspection was to determine if there was any sediment buildup and assess the integrity of the pipe to determine if additional load (i.e. increase the height of the tailings stack) could be applied as part of the North Extension project. 
The pipe is ~18"" ID HDPE (~23.5"", DR9) with butt-fusion welds every ~40 feet and is approximately 800 feet long. The fusion beads are approximately 1"" thick. 
ASM begin their inspection at the upstream end of the pipe in the Pond 9 caisson. Proper confined space entry procedures were followed. The camera was set in the pipe and began tramming down the pipe. ASM was able to successfully get the camera approximately 600 feet down the pipe before they were unable to cross a fusion bead. In efforts to cross the bead ASM indicates the data cable may have gotten looped around one of the wheels on the camera carrier, but this is not certain. After failing to cross the bead ASM began to retrieve the camera. 
The video footage shows that as the camera was pulled back out of the pipe the camera would occasional ride up on the side of the pipe and partially tip over, but then right itself as it was pulled out. This progressed until the camera was approximately 320 feet from the pipe inlet at which time the camera flipped on its side and became stuck against a fusion bead.
The contractor attempted to flush the camera downgradient by placing a piece of pipe over the caisson inlet and allowing water to build up in the caisson and then removing the plywood using a line attached to the plywood. However, with approximately 300 feet of cable attached to the camera flushing did not work. 
When flushing didn't work ASM made the decision to attempt to pull the camera out so they attached a come-along to the cable, a large shackle to the 16"" pipe on the opposite side of the caisson and pulled until the cable parted off. Almost all of the cable was retrieved, but the camera is still stuck in the pipe. 
ASM subsequently packaged up the rest of their gear and left site.","","","Aaron Marsh","Aaron Marsh (070855)","Closed","","10/17/2020","","en"

This particular area that we were utilizing for storage is located next to our Zinc Sulfate solution storage tank and the bottom drain could've easily been damaged when the super sack rolled off the top pallet and onto the floor. If the drain had been damaged we would have not been able to stop the flow of Zn sulfate and the entirety of the tank would have ended up in our emergency sump area, creating additional hazards. In total approximately 25 gallons came out of the toppled super sack and 5-10 gallons came out of the bag that was next to the bag which toppled.

Looking at the data, it looked like the pH had been lower then normal since the last calibration on the 7th. 
I calibrated the sonde and was still getting a lower value then the hand-held. So I pulled the device out of the river and replaced it with the sonde from AB#1. I'm currently sending the initial sonde to the manufacturer for repair. 
In order to prevent this issue from occurring in the future, or at the very least reducing the chance that we didn't catch it in time, we are going to check the hand-held pH meter against the sondes every business day and recalibrate when needed.

We got some flow going and filter back on-line and things were ok for shift change.  Oncoming crew member Rocky Kimmel went to check filter room and noticed the flow to the zinc vat had changed, Cord and I went back to help investigate, we did a series of quick test and determined that the ods was plugged.  The Zinc circuit was very loaded up so with the circumstances going on we reduced TPH to 38 from 45-46 at 6:30pm.  We did a fairly common practice to get ods unplugged, the line was clear to the vat, diaphragm section was flushed and cleared. and then we noticed what is referred to as the cone, very bottom section of the thickener was cleared.  With all the drains open we could see clumps of zinc fall in the cone from the thickener be, we tried air lance up into the bed, put the hotsy line up in the bed of the thickener and didn't have any success unblocking the plug.  A call was made to the foreman and we discussed shutting down the mill, until we could fix the problem, starting shutting down at 9:30pm.  As we shut down and reduced flow to the Thickener, I stuck a 20' pvc pipe into the top of the thickener and hit solids about a 2 feet in.  We estimated that it was appx. 80% full of packed in ZN con.  Also we noticed that there was 104 on the pressure gauge and 2 on the rake torque.  We had an idea that the rakes were broke, but the shaft was still spinning.  We spent the majority of 3 shifts emptying out the thickener, day shift was to make quite a bit of shippable cons, until density became and issue.  We spent last night cleaning the rest of the material out so maintenance can develop a plan to fix the rakes, which the drive shaft twisted and broke from the rakes.","","","Scott Hogamier","Scott Hogamier (009438)","Assign for Investigation","6/18/2020","","Health & Safety Coordinator","en"

I Mike Little,  rushed out to the plant and tried to figure out what was going on.  Cord Jensen gave us an idea of a process to use to get valve unstuck and it did not work.  Cord came in and switched some air line back and forth and finally the valve closed.  This underflow valve dumps a 6"" line to the floor sump and has a timer button.  The air to the timer button has been locked out for over the two years I have been back and has not been a common practice to use for years because the valve had stuck on prior operators and flooded out the building.  We have an alternate way of dumping the clarifier that does not put it to the floor, rather to P-52 which reports to the Final tails thickener.  I asked Aaron why he decided to use this process, and he was told that another crew said they used it and the timer valved worked.  There was no ops lock or anything blocking this method that has been locked for several years.  So in conclusion, someone decided to remove the ops lock and start using this process that has failed in the past.  Booms were in place at the roll up door and all the solids from clarifier settled in the sump and in the building, appx 75-100 gallons of clean water made its way out the door, running directly into the event pond","","","Scott Hogamier","Environmental Coordinator","Assign for Investigation","6/9/2020","","Health & Safety Coordinator","en"

Like it needs the cutting edge replaced the fuel cap won't close like it had been bent or something.  That made me curious and I decided to go take a look at it, I first checked out the grader blade, then climbed up looking over the operator compartment where I found the seat belt not functioning like was mentioned. I then look down the hood toward the fuel fill cap and saw that everything on top of the hood had damage. The coolant over flow bottle yellow cover was no where to be found (it had been completely ripped off the hood) and the coolant bottle top was almost torn clear off the bottle, and had a rag wrapped around the neck. The exhaust was damaged(bent) and the exhaust wrap was peeled of the tail pipe to about half way back. The air bonnet had scratches on it.

I called for assistance from the on shift maintenance guy to come and inspect. Upon arrival the mechanic thought he would be able to pull the loose fitting and tape it up and re-install and stop the leak. Mechanic completed what he thought would help and then let me know what he had done. After watching the pump kick on several more times the leak was continuously getting worse and I called the mechanic back to the location and asked if had what he needed to swap out the fitting that was leaking with a new one in hopes this would stop our steady leaking gear tac issue. Mechanic came up with parts that he believed would get us through the night and into day shift when there would be more personnel and experience in dealing with this system.  Mechanic took apart the fitting and started to replace the leaking setup with what he had built, but by the time he had it put back together an audible alarm had went off for the lube system. We were able to silence the alarm and the mechanic was able to quickly finish his job and we could see locally that the pump was indeed starting and cycling in a normal like fashion, however the alarm continued to sound off every 3-5 minutes and needed reset. I let it go off 3 times in hopes that it may just need to reestablish flow and pressure. Once it went off a 4th time I called the maintenance general foreman for help and to answer some questions. He was able to get a hold of one of his experienced hands to come on site and assist with further tests and troubleshooting. After about an hour we had come to fact that we would need to grind out and prep the mills for shutdown so maintenance could further test and diagnose the issue. Maintenance replace the spray nozzle on the gear lube line thinking it may be plugged. This did not work and they ended up replacing the solenoid box that actuates and lets lube spray as needed before we were able to fire back up.","","","Casey Snook","","Closed","","4/16/2021","","en"

The relief Supervisor and crew members shut down the plant in a controlled but swift manner.  After some inspection it was found that a significant amount of anthracite was in the clean water backwash tank, after a backwash is complete in a vessel the water in the C.W.B.T must be refilled as it uses 30% of the tank in the backwash process, so all the outfall water reports to it and then reports to the river.  The C.W.B.T. caught the majority of the anthracite and then a minimal amount was discharged to the river.  We did some further testing through the plant and measured each vessel and determined that the #1 MMF vessel was the problem.  We Performed a LOTO on the #1 vessel and removed the lid so further investigation can be done  determine what the actual failure was.

The other agitator had been turned up to help agitation while the inoperable was down.  There was also and air lance inserted in the tank to help agitation.  When they turned on the inoperable one they turned it on and up to match the speed of the working one, with both of them working, turned up, and the air lance still on and in the tank, it caused a disruption to the filtration process, stirring up a bunch of material and overloading the clarifier, blinding off the Disc filter and sending it into continuous backwashing cycles.  This also causes our Effluent numbers to rise.  This was caught quick and we were able to remedy the situation before any detrimental environmental release took place.

The cylinder was connected to the hydraulic pump to be pressure tested to test for leaks and functionality before installing. The cylinder was pressured up, and passed all of the leak and functionality testing. The pressure gauge on the hydraulic system indicated that the pressure was bleeding off, the pump and power unit were turned off and locked out to prevent re-energization. After the hydraulic gauge reached 0, the driller then began to break the hose fitting between the hydraulic system and the feed cylinder. While wiggling the fitting loose hydraulic fluid that was still under pressure sprayed out towards the drillers face. The driller put his hand up to prevent the fluid from getting in his eyes. After the fluid contacted his hand, which was 4-6"" away from the fitting, he felt some mild tingling and a slight burning sensation. The drillers took a few minutes to clean and inspect the hand that was sprayed and decided it wasn't worth risking, so they drove to the 5900 shifter's shack for assistance. Upon reaching the shifters shack the shifters got in touch with the hoistman and the safety department and notified them of the incident. The shifter's brought the diamond drillers immediately to 5100 Silver Shaft station for a ride out. As soon as the drillers reached the surface, the driller with the possible injury was transported immediately to Shoshone Medical Center for further treatment.","","","Lance Boylan","","Closed","","4/14/2021","","en"

It was assumed that all the reagents were turned off during  the shutdown.  However one reagent was missed during dayshift and that was the Lime to the zinc flash.  This stayed on through the night and this extra lime was makings its way through the sump system to P52, into  the thickener and eventually through WTP 002.  The water treatment operator noticed the pH was higher than usual, which is not much of concern considering this was at the tail end of a mill run and this can happen.  But as it continued to increase he notified the on shift supervisor and the supervisor knew to go check all the lime sources and found one was still on.  He shut off the lime to the Zinc flash and began monitoring pH more frequently to see when it left the system.  He also contacted the mill manager to determine what the high end limits were on pH at WTP 002.  He noted that the pH got at high as 9.6 before it began petering back off.  Our limit at WTP 002 is 10.0 so it was very close to peaking out over our limit.  We were lucky he was able to identify the source before it the level went over the limit.","","","Lance Boylan","","Closed","","2/17/2020","","en"

This resulted in the underflow valves of both Zn column cells to be  stuck open with no way to operate the air actuated valves.  Both columns started emptying into the basement faster that the floor sump could pump it out.  Booms were placed around the doors at the bottom of the Zn columns to minimize a spill outside of the building, and air was bypassed to the instrument air dryer allowing the valves to be operated again.  In that time approx. 100 gallons of water mixed with Zn column cell overflow leaked around the booms and out the doors.  This spill then reports to the alley, which is graded to the event pond.  While the air was not functioning the feed to the mill was stopped.  It was turned back on 25-30 minutes later and the sand plant remained in operation.  The sand plant, WTP-002, and Pumphouse #4 were unaffected by the air loss, as their feed is separate.","","","Lance Boylan","","Closed","","2/6/2020","","en"

We have to unbolt the channel iron on the lip of the bottom deck to be able to lift open the trap door and secure it open. Others have discovered that leaving one bolt loose in the channel iron and removing the rest you can spin the iron so that most of its weight is over the wooden work deck on the fork lift. This limits the risk of dropping the iron. We would sometimes have the operator take the wooden deck and iron away, then move to the next step of lifting the trap door. Usually 2 people would stand on each side of the trap door, one would lift it exposing the open shaft. The assisting toplander asked if we wanted to just leave the wooden deck in-place under the deck as close to the cage rollers as he could so it would minimize the amount of exposed open shaft to the people on the bottom deck securing the door.Worked great, NOW we need to incorporate the wooden deck use while tying off the trailing cable ends.

It helps to drop more solids out of the overflow, allowing cleaner water to move forward in the filtering stages.  We put this material in the transfer tank which pumps it to the Surge tank.  From time to time we need to dump our underflow to alleviate the solids to Pond 3(soon to be a different destination).  After the dump we return the flow back to the Surge Tanks.  However the Relief Supervisor observed the Operator adding bentonite the transfer tank while he was dumping.  Thus sending the new addition of bentonite directly to the pond.  This has created a loss of process.

Upon inspecting the cords, they did not observe any obvious damage to the jacket, the insulation, the plug, or the socket.  The plug was wet, so the EE attempted to dry it with his gloves.  EE considered the hazard, but did not think it would be an issue since everything was intact.  I plugged the plug into the socket.  It made a loud noise.

The sand plant had not been operated in approximately 3 months.  During that time new barrels were installed in the Schwing pump.  When water was initially sent through the system, operators noticed that the lower U-shaped hopper was not sitting in its saddle like it should.  This caused a very large water leak all along the hopper.  Operators planned to wait and see if the leak would seal itself with sand if the pour was started.  However, when 12-stope called for sand and the operators attempted to switch from water to sand the system program would not initialize to start the emergency belt and BC44.  Operators spent approximately 30 minutes trouble shooting the problems before help was requested from electrical.  Additional electricians were sent up from the underground to assist.  The electricians brought the programming laptop to the sandplant control room and utilized skype to allow a subject matter expert to remote in to the program and force the sequence to restart.  Once that was completed the operators were able to start pouring sand but realized the water leak was too much sand to keep the pour going.  The time was 11:30 which would require all employees on the surface and underground to stay late to get it finished.  The pour was canceled for the day and the pour was rescheduled for the next day which would allow the maintenance department to seal the hopper.","","","Lance Boylan","","Investigate","11/22/2019","","Craig Shiner (009460)","en"

South side was descaled with no issues, North side was partially descaled and not completed due to the tool used and the angle of work.  Employee reviewed the status of the job on the shift report and verbally with the dayshift crew. On 8-18-19 employee set up a 6' ladder and a 12' scaling bar and waited for the co-worker that would monitor him.  Employee scaled down several small portions and then noticed as he pried that the full length of the chute was likely going to be falling at once due to the separation that occurred during dayshift.  The scaled slab did fall in one piece hitting the floor approximately 2 feet south and to the east of the ladder.  Employee immediately dropped the bar and got off the ladder.  When the scaled piece hit the floor a lot of dust was created and the employee could not see so he went and stood by his co-worker until the dust settled.

We went to the valve yard to the west of the bldg to look for labeling / isolation valves. There are 3 in ground frost fee isolation valve at a depth of approx 3-4'. We tested 2 of the isolations and tried to bleed the pressure off of the system. The small isolation valve which is in the southeastern most corner of the area is an 1 1/2"" - 90 degree turn valve. We isolated it and tested the line pressure to see if it would drop. It did not, we left this valve (In what we thought was the closed position for several minutes and checked with the hoist room and Mill to see if this interrupted any water supply to either area.) We then checked the larger valve inches away from the 1 1/2"" next while having the mill monitor flow to the mill. This did not impact the mill flow. We reopened the isolation and noticed water welling up from underground. The 1 1/2"" line was apparently already isolated and is either not capped at a dead end U/G or has a broken line that was left isolated. Mill Supervisor found a tag lying on the ground in the area but no longer attached that said DO NOT OPEN THIS VALVE. I called a project engineer to research the drawings to see if we could determine what line had been opened on the maps and to search for the correct isolation that feeds the slickline bldg. The Amount spilled is a difficult estimation because we do not 100% know the source. We assume it is tied into the Mill Fresh water line at some point. But the area maps are not kept up and there have been previous lines discovered due to the age of the site that are not on the maps.","","","Becky Colotti","","Closed","","6/3/2020","","en"

I thought maybe he didn't have clear ones to put on because I observed him operating earlier and he had the tinted sunglass style safety glasses on.  I stopped and motioned the Project Mgr. Asst. Al Elge over and asked ""Does he need some clear glasses"".  Al looked over and realized he didn't have any on.  About that time they lowered the lift and came out and as soon as the Genie operator exited the lift he put his dark safety glasses back on.  I asked him directly ""hey do you need some clear safety glasses?"" and he stated he had some up top on the mine dump but would have taken them off to operate the controls while inside the building anyway.  I also asked if the Vendor had updated task training (he told them he did) I verified on our matrix it was expired and for someone else from their company so I suggested while he was here they get the training done.

We tried to trip the Interlocks for the Lube system after the Stop button failed to shut it down. The Interlocks did not stop it either so we quickly restarted the Lube system. We then tried the ""Stop All"" button on the panel at the Ball mill and everything (including the lube system again) shut down, but not the Ball Mill.
